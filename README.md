# COMET Regression Model Training Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to train a COMET regression model from scratch on Google Colab. COMET (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation) is a neural framework designed for evaluating machine translation quality by leveraging multilingual pre-trained language models. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Overview

The notebook, `COMET_scratch_edited.ipynb`, provides a step-by-step guide to:

1. **Setting Up the Environment**: Installing necessary libraries and configuring the environment for training.
2. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing datasets required for training the COMET model.
3. **Model Architecture**: Defining the COMET model architecture based on the XLM-R pre-trained encoder.
4. **Training the Model**: Training the COMET model using the prepared data.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on validation data.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook on Google Colab:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Access the notebook via the following link:
   - [COMET_scratch_edited.ipynb](https://github.com/AaryaPakhale/COMET_pipeline/blob/main/COMET_scratch_edited.ipynb)
2. **Set Up the Environment**: Execute the initial cells to install required packages and set up the environment.
3. **Follow the Steps**: Proceed through the notebook, following the instructions provided in each section.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed in your environment.
- **Libraries**: The notebook will handle the installation of necessary libraries, including `transformers`, `torch`, and `datasets`.
